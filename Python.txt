Text Files : 
	.txt
	.csv
	.json
	.xls
	.pdf

Text Files Mode :

	r   : Read Mode (r): Opens a file for reading. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.


	r+  : Read and Write Mode (r+): Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.


	w   : Write Mode (w): Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates (clears) the file before writing. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new file.


	w+  : Write and Read Mode (w+): Opens a file for both writing and reading. It truncates the file if it exists, or creates a new file if it doesn’t. 


	a   : Append Mode (a): Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if it exists. If the file doesn’t exist, it creates a new file.


	a+   : Append and Read Mode (a+): Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if it exists, or creates a new file if it doesn’t.


Binary Files :
	.jpg
	.jpeg
	.mp4
	.mp3
	.mkv


Binary File Modes :

	rb  : (read binary): Opens a file for reading in binary format.

	rb+ : (read and write binary): Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format.

	wb  :  (write binary): Opens a file for writing in binary format. If the file already exists, it will be truncated.

	wb+ : (write and read binary): Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. If the file already exists, it will be truncated.

	ab  : (append binary): Opens a file for appending in binary format. Data is added to the end of the file.

	ab+ :  (append and read binary): Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format.

	xb  : 



In Python Must Use Single Codes ('') For String 




Loads : Convert Json Object Into Python Dict Object

Dumps : Convert Python Dict Object Into Json Object

Load : Insert File --> Json File To Python File

Dump : Insert File --> Python File To Json File



DIR --> Display The Attributes Of Module In The Form Of List

			put()
			delete()
		} ----> File Pointer Members
		
	Json :
		{
			load()
			loads()
			dump()
			dumps()

Exception Handling :
	Try : This block lets you test a block of code for errors.

	Except : This block lets you handle the error. ---->(keyword : alternative )

	Finally : This block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try and except blocks.

	raise : This keyword is used to raise an exception manually.



Case 2 :

	Invoke Rest API's Using Request Module

Example :

	api_url = '<Api URL Link Paste Here'
	users = none
	try :
		users = requests.get(api_url)
		users = users.json()
	except :
		fp = open('user.json','r')
		users = json.load(fp)

Python Has 35 Keyword 
	
	Self Is A Keyword Pointing To Current object.

Python Class & Object Methods :
	
	To create :
	
	Instance Method:
		
		a) Inside Class Constructor --> Using Self

		b) Inside Class Instance --> Using Self

		c) Outside Class --> Using Object

	Static Method :

		a) Inside Class --> Outside Method

		b) Inside Class --> Using Class Name

		c) Outside Class Using Class Name




	To Read :
		
		a) Inside Class --> Using Self

		b) Outside Class --> Objectx
